# 11ty-multi - Adapted from eleventy-template-multiplicity

Large portions of this README are not relevant for this instance. I will
be editing this more fully as I further develop the project. This is being
built as a tool to help me in identifying content for the [11tybundle.dev](https://11tybundle.dev/) site.

## Multiplicity - RSS Aggregator Starter Based On Eleventy

**Multiplicity** (abbreviated as 'm10y') is a simple starter pack based on [Eleventy static site generator](https://11ty.dev) that allows you to create RSS aggregator site.

Alongside the template code, it also contains a GitHub action required to keep the site up to date.
